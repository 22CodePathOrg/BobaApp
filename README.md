[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]

- **Mobile:** Using Camera, Audio and user profiles are saved.
- **Story:** I think rating the drinks will be interesting and will attract users
- **Market:** As I said earlier we can create different types of drink ratings and attract customers
- **Habit:** If we update quizes drinks offered regularly there will be growth. As people drink bearages atleast once per day
- **Scope:** Hopefully we can complete this app by the end of this program. But this a big app so will try to complete required stories
